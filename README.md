## ETCD Admin Controller for Amazon EKS Anywhere

The etcdadm-controller is responsible for managing external etcd clusters created by Amazon EKS Anywhere (EKS-A)

Amazon EKS Anywhere is a new deployment option for Amazon EKS that enables you to easily create and operate Kubernetes clusters on-premises with your own virtual machines.
It brings a consistent AWS management experience to your data center, building on the strengths of [Amazon EKS Distro](https://github.com/aws/eks-distro), the same distribution of Kubernetes that powers EKS on AWS.
Its goal is to include full lifecycle management of multiple Kubernetes clusters that are capable of operating completely independently of any AWS services.

Here are the steps for [getting started](https://anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/docs/getting-started/) with EKS Anywhere.
Full documentation for releases can be found on [https://anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com](https://anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/).
